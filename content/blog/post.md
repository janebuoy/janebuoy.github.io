As a front-end developer, one of the things that I find most interesting is the intersection of design and development. In this post, I want to share some of my favorite tips and tricks for working with CSS and typography.

## Choosing the Right Font

When it comes to typography, one of the most important decisions you can make is choosing the right font. There are literally thousands of fonts to choose from, and each one has its own unique character and personality.

Here are a few tips for choosing the right font:

- Consider the mood and tone of your project. A formal, corporate website will likely require a different font than a fun, playful app.
- Think about readability. If your font is too hard to read, it will turn visitors away.
- Make sure the font is appropriate for the content. A script font might look pretty, but it might not be the best choice for a technical article.

## Working with Font Sizes

Once you've chosen a font, you'll need to decide on the appropriate font size. This can be a bit tricky, as font sizes are usually measured in pixels, which can make them hard to compare.

Here are a few tips for working with font sizes:

- Use a consistent font size hierarchy. This means using a larger font size for headings, a slightly smaller font size for subheadings, and an even smaller font size for body text.
- Avoid using extremely small font sizes. Anything below 12 pixels can be hard to read, especially for people with vision impairments.
- Remember that font sizes are relative. A font size of 16 pixels might be small on a desktop screen, but it could be quite large on a mobile device.

## Styling Text with CSS

CSS provides a number of ways to style text, including font weight, font style, text transform, and text decoration.

### Font Weight

The `font-weight` property allows you to control the boldness of your text. The most common values are `normal` and `bold`, but you can also use values like `100`, `200`, `300`, and so on, up to `900`.

```css
.bold {
  font-weight: bold;
}
```
